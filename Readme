--- Readme documentation for DS5220 - Project codes

We have created two separate ipynb notebooks - One for EDA and Machine Learning models using scikit learn, 
and the other for pytorch LSTM Deep Learning implementation (using Google Colab)


Machine Learning:
We need to run the all the functions in separate cells.
Load data in correct location and then load it into the kernel. Load packages and run each cell to view the code output and evaluation metrics


Deep Learning:
We need to run the all the functions in separate cells.

input_size = input size
n_layers = number of laayers in the network
activation_list = list of activation functions
